## Question 1

**What is retrieval-augmented generation?**

### Answer

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving information from external knowledge resources during the text generation process [0]. This method actively decides when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation, allowing LLMs to gather information continuously throughout the process. RAG has been shown to be effective in mitigating hallucinations and improving performance on various tasks such as question answering, text summarization, and more [1][2][3][6]. There are different types of RAG methods, including dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (DRAG) [2], which actively decides when and what to retrieve during the text generation process, and parametric retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG), which rethinks how the retrieved knowledge should be incorporated into the LLM [1]. Other approaches include structured RAG (SRAG) [4], which systematically organizes extracted entities into relational tables for better analysis, and DioR [6], an adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval optimization method that determines when retrieval is needed and what to retrieve. Additionally, there are methods like GraphFlow [9] that efficiently retrieve accurate and diverse knowledge from text-rich knowledge graphs. Overall, RAG has shown great potential in enhancing the performance of LLMs by providing them with external knowledge during generation.
