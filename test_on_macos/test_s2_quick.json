          "title": "CRISPR gene editing to improve crop resistance to parasitic plants",
          "text": "Parasitic plants pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing substantial crop losses and hampering food security. In recent years, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) gene-editing technology has emerged as a promising tool for developing resistance against various plant pathogens. Its application in combating parasitic plants, however, remains largely unexplored. This review aims to summarise current knowledge and research gaps in utilising CRISPR to develop resistance against parasitic plants. First, we outline recent improvements in CRISPR gene editing tools, and what has been used to combat various plant pathogens. To realise the immense potential of CRISPR, a greater understanding of the genetic basis underlying parasitic plant-host interactions is critical to identify suitable target genes for modification. Therefore, we discuss the intricate interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts, highlighting essential genes and molecular mechanisms involved in defence response and multilayer resistance. These include host resistance responses directly repressing parasitic plant germination or growth and indirectly influencing parasitic plant development via manipulating environmental factors. Finally, we evaluate CRISPR-mediated effectiveness and long-term implications for host resistance and crop improvement, including inducible resistance response and tissue-specific activity. In conclusion, this review highlights the challenges and opportunities CRISPR technology provides to combat parasitic plants and provides insights for future research directions to safeguard global agricultural productivity.",

          "text": "In his 1959 Nobel Lecture, Joshua Lederberg discusses the specific mutagen, an agent that could ‘penetrate to a given gene, recognize and modify it in a specific way’, as the ignis fatuus of genetics, a potentially unobtainable goal that one feels compelled to pursue. While several contenders emerged over the years, it was not until 2012 that Charpentier and Doudna truly realized Lederberg’s goal with their description of an easily programmable RNA-guided DNA endonuclease known as CRISPR Cas9 [1], which when used in combination with a DNA donor template, opened the path to a cure for genetic diseases by precise genome editing [2]. In the final months of the first decade of CRISPR, this editorial reviews the impact of CRISPR technology on respiratory medicine.",

          "text": "abstract:Today's debate about the use of gene-editing technologies to alter human DNA brings together two longstanding lines of inquiry in bioethics: the ethics of human enhancement, and the ethics of heritable genetic modification. This article traces that lineage by identifying key distinctions and ethics questions in these preexisting lines of inquiry that are also employed in four recent policy and ethics statements on human gene editing. These distinctions and ethics questions can be helpful heuristics for organizing discussion, learning from existing analysis, and highlighting what is at stake with new gene-editing technologies. Yet scientists, policymakers, and others new to the ethics of emerging technologies should also be aware of both the limitations of these distinctions and past challenges in adequately addressing the ethics questions they raise. In particular, the treatment-enhancement distinction and the somatic-germline distinction are not as clear-cut as they might initially appear. More importantly, they cannot be used to definitively differentiate right from wrong uses of the technologies in question.",

Currently, there are various criticism concerning CRISPR since the technology is still immature. It’s important to address these concerns to ensure that CRISPR wouldn't cause harms to the society. The purpose of this investigation is to summarize methods which can be used to solve the risks and ethical issues regarding CRISPR through examining published researches in-depth. To draw a conclusion, scientists can use anti-crispr protein to minimize the off-target effects. For immunity issues, scientists can employ immunosuppressive drugs or to use CRISPR in places where immune system cannot reach. What’s more, given both legal and ethical hurdles, the problem of designer babies and bio-weapons are unlikely to happen. Therefore, although there are various concerns regarding CRISPR, scientists are figuring out ways to minimize the risks and to optimize the usage of the CRISPR.",
